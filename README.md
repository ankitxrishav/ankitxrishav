### Hey, I’m Ankit! 👋

I’m an AIML undergraduate who enjoys building systems where **machine learning meets real-world constraints**.

I focus on real problems and try to solve them in simple, practical ways using whatever tools make sense. If something works, it works , **the tool matters less than the outcome.**.

I like projects that go beyond models — ones that involve design, architecture, and iteration.

Most of my work is experimental in nature: I try ideas, break things, and rebuild them until they feel right.
